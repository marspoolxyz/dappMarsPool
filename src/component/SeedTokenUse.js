                <p>SEED Tokens are harvested by LAND Token owners on daily basis. There will be 1786 
                    LAND owners harvesting 10 SEEDs every day for the next 60 months starting from 
                    the LAND Sale date.

                    SEED Tokens play a vital role in the ecosystem, as the project owners, 
                    who are willing to raise funds from the MarsPool community need to acquire SEEDs and burn 
                    them to list the project. As more and more projects get attention to the MarsPool community
                    SEEDs will be scarce as SEEDs are burnt and can be harvested only by the NFT LAND Owners.                    
                </p>
                
                <p> 
                    SEEDs can be used to register the LAND owner's name in the block-chain, 
                    meaning when MarsPool LAND token owner wants to give a name to his/her LAND token,
                    there is a cost associated with registering the unique name to LAND. SEEDs send to the 
                    name registration contract shall be burnt, which reduces the total supply of the SEEDs token 
                    at a given point of time. SEEDs can only be harvested by (NFT) LAND token owners.
